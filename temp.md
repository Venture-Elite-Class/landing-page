Awesome, on the courses page, I want you to add courses in this pattern, there are multiple offerings:

This is the first section and this will be on the top and covers the entire row, this in itself is a long card 1. Cloud + Artificial Intelligence Priced at 2499 USD

This is the second section and this will be after the above and covers the entire row partitioned into a group of four cards:
Cloud + AI + SC  Priced at 3499 USD
Cloud + AI + DP  Priced at 3499 USD
Cloud + AI + PL  Priced at 3499 USD
Cloud + AI + MS  Priced at 3499 USD

This is the third section and this will be after the above and covers the entire row partitioned into a group of two cards:
Cloud + AI + DP + PL  Priced at 4499 USD
Cloud + AI + MS + SC  Priced at 4499 USD

each card should have a title, description, and price.
Each of these terms i.e. Cloud, AI, SC, DP, PL, MS should indicate in the description about the certification that will be provided in that package.

Also add features to each of the packages.

Features offered in each package:
Linkedin profile optimization workshop
Resume Review Workshop
